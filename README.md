# Sign-Language-Gesture-Analysis
The Sign Language Gesture Analysis project focuses on detecting, recognizing, and interpreting hand gestures used in sign language. It leverages computer vision and machine learning to enhance communication accessibility for the hearing-impaired community.
Programming language : Python

Software Requirements :  
1. Visual Studio Code (VS Code)
2. Webcam
3. Python
Libraries Used:  
1. TensorFlow
2. OpenCV
3. Keras
4. NumPy

Hardware specifications necessary for development and deployment include:   
• Laptop/ PC : with the following minimum specification.  
• Processor: intel Core i5 or above.  
• RAM: 8GB (16GB preferred for the smoother operation).  
• Storage: SSD with at least 256 GB available space. • Operating System: Windows 10/11.
 • Camera: High-quality, 3MP
 • RAM: Minimum 8GB or higher

Conclusion :  
Nowadays, applications require a wide variety of images as a source of information for 
interpretation and analysis. There are many features to remove to run various applications. 
When an image is converted from one form to another such as digitizing, scanning and 
communication, storage etc. Therefore, the output image undergoes a process called image 
correction, which consists of a set of methods that try to enhance the appearance of the image. 
Image enhancement is basically about clarifying or raising awareness of information in 
images for the human audience and providing better input for other automated image 
processing systems.
